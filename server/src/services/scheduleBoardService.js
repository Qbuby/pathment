/**
 * A day as blocks that hold things.
 *
 * A schedule slot used to be a RULE ("make a discussion task every Monday") or
 * a POINTER ("work through these roadmaps"). It was never "here are the three
 * things in this block today", which is why nothing could be dragged into a
 * block, out of one, or ticked off: there was no "in".
 *
 * Nothing new is stored to fix that. `assigned_tasks.schedule_slot_id` already
 * existed and was already indexed — only the recurring materializer wrote it,
 * and nothing read it. So:
 *
 *   what is in this block   → one indexed read
 *   move it to another      → one column write
 *   mark it done            → the task lifecycle that already exists
 *
 * An item on a plan is an ordinary task, so submissions, mentor feedback,
 * points and the daily progress log keep working with no second system to
 * disagree with the first.
 *
 * ── Who may change what ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every slot carries `owner` and `locked`. Slots written before this shipped
 * have neither, and are read as mentor-owned and unlocked, which is what they
 * were.
 *
 *   mentor-owned, unlocked  mentee fills it, moves it, renames it (marked as
 *                           changed, so "apply to all" leaves it alone)
 *   mentor-owned, locked    mentee fills it and nothing else — the standup
 *                           stays at 09:00
 *   mentee-owned            the mentee's own time; a mentor can see it and
 *                           never overwrites it
 *
 * Locking protects a block's SHAPE, not its contents. What you bring to the
 * standup is always yours.
