/**
 * Top-performer nominations.
 *
 * An admin running a fellowship of several hundred cannot know who deserves the
 * recognition. A mentor of a dozen can — but an admin cannot simply take their
 * word for it either, and asking them to is how recognition quietly becomes a
 * popularity contest.
 *
 * So three things are put side by side and none of them decides alone:
 *
 *   the ranking    what the record says, computed live from the same composite
 *                  the certificates already grade on, so this is not a third
 *                  definition of "doing well" competing with the other two
 *   the reasoning  what the mentor knows that the record cannot hold, required
 *                  of them, because a nomination without it is only a vote
 *   the evidence   the roadmap and the tasks under it, already on screen behind
 *                  the certificate drawer
 *
 * The disagreement is the useful part. Nominated and ranked first needs no
 * scrutiny; nominated and ranked fourteenth of twenty tells an admin precisely
 * where to read closely — without overruling a mentor who may be right about
 * something no metric holds.
