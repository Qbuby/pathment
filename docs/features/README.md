# Pathment - Feature Guide

This folder is the **feature-by-feature manual** for Pathment. Each file explains one
feature end to end: what it is, why it exists, the data behind it, the backend flow, the
frontend, and - most importantly - **what each role (admin / mentor / mentee) actually
does**. Read a single file and you'll understand that feature without reading code.

> For the big picture first, read **[../ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md)** (how the
> system fits together) and **[../DATABASE.md](../DATABASE.md)** (the full data model).
> These feature docs go one level deeper, per feature.

## How each doc is structured

Every feature file follows the same template so things are easy to find and remember:

1. **What it is** - one or two sentences.
2. **Why it exists** - the problem it solves.
3. **Data model** - the tables involved (see DATABASE.md for full columns).
4. **Backend** - key services + the API endpoints.
5. **Frontend** - the pages/components.
6. **Role flows** - the journey for admin, mentor, and mentee.
7. **Rules & edge cases** - the non-obvious logic.
8. **Related** - links to adjacent features.

*Keep these honest:* when you change a feature, update its file here. A doc that lies is
worse than no doc. New feature → add a file and link it in the table above.
